        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Xadiel, a passionate software developer from San Juan, Puerto Rico. I hold a degree in Computer
            Science from the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, where I graduated in 2023. My professional journey
            has led me to work with a diverse set of technologies across various industries. I've gained substantial
            experience working with .NET, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle DB, and in another role, I delved into Spring
            Boot with Java, MariaDB, and Power BI. Currently, I'm leveraging Salesforce, Vlocity, Copado, and Heroku in
            my work.

            I'm always on the lookout for exciting business ideas and innovative projects. Recently, I've been expanding
            my skills into mobile development using Flutter. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I’m eager
            to connect with like-minded professionals. If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to chat about
            tech and business ideas, feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!</p>
